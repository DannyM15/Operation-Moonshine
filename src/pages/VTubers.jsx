                    <div className="col-6">In Willowbrook, a man named Bagstard always wore a paper bag over his head, causing the townspeople to avoid him. He lived in solitude at the forest's edge, tending to his vibrant garden and leaving baskets of produce for his neighbors. One day, a lost girl named Lily knocked on his door, and he kindly took her in, explaining that the bag helped people see him for who he truly was. After safely guiding Lily back home, the townspeople began to see Bagstardâ€™s true kindness and welcomed him into their community. No longer lonely, Bagstard became a cherished friend, teaching Willowbrook to look beyond appearances. </div>
